      - !p >
        This document aims to describe the format of documents written to be
        used with ydtar. Because of the highly flexible nature of ydtar, the
        document format is concise but can be vauge.

      - !p >
        The basic concept of ydtar documents is to describe the content that the
        author wishes to write without specifying the detailed output structure.
        The content of the document exists in segments, nested YAML data that is
        parsed by a domain specific language custom for taking in ydtar-style
        documents and ouputting a desired format known as a target spe. Whether
        the target spec be HTML, LaTeX, WikiCode, BBcode, or even plaintext, the
        input document reamins the same. All the author has to be concerned with
        is the flow of the content and specifying the type of the content they
        are creating.
      - !note >
        The simplicity of expression in ydtar comes at the cost of universality.
        Using nonstandard segment types with non-robust target specs could cause
        issues. Eventually a default segment spec should be added, but that will
        have to come in later versions. If you have issues with a document, look
        through the target spec to see what tag you should be using.
